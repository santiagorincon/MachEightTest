# MachEightTest
Coding Challenge - Santiago Rinc√≥n

To run this code you have to create a new text file (.txt) with text data, this data must have in each line (Pleae leave a space between both):
<<list of integers separated by comma (',')>> <<desired result>>
  
Example:
1,9,5,0,20,-4,12,16,7 12

Once you get ready with the file, you need to update the file URL in the code. To do that I recommend to use Visual Studio and open the project, after that you will find the file:
MachEightTest/Program.cs

In this file you can change the file URL in line 8, using the current value ('C:\MachEightTest\input.txt', if you use the same URL in your file you wont need to update the code) as a guide.
  
After that you can run the code using the Run option in Visual Studio.
  
  
Note: If you can't setup the input file, in the first line of the code you will find a guide to run that manually
